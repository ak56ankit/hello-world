## Flappy Bird Game

This repository includes a small Flappy Bird clone inside the `flappy-bird` folder.
To play it locally:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `flappy-bird` directory:
   ```bash
   cd flappy-bird
   ```
2. Serve the folder with any static file server. A quick option using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Alternatively, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser, though some
features may work best via a local server.
